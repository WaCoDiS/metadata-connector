Climate changes and the ongoing intensification of agriculture effect in increased material inputs in watercourses and dams.
Thus, water industry associations, suppliers and municipalities face new challenges. To ensure an efficient and environmentally
friendly water supply for the future, adjustments on changing conditions are necessary. Hence, the research project WaCoDiS
aims to geo-locate and quantify material outputs from agricultural areas and to optimize models for sediment and material
inputs (nutrient contamination) into watercourses and dams. Therefore, approaches for combining heterogeneous data sources,
existing interoperable web based information systems and innovative domain oriented models will be explored.

### Architecture Overview

For a detailed overview about the WaCoDiS system architecture please visit the 
**[WaCoDiS Core Engine](https://github.com/WaCoDiS/core-engine)** repository.  

## Overview  
The WaCoDiS Metadata Connector is an intermediate component with the scope to handle asynchronous DataEnvelope creation
events in order to interact with the DataAccess API for creating new metadata resources. Therefore, the Metadata Connector
subscribes for DataEnvelope creation messages at a message broker which are published by the 
**[Datasource Observer](https://github.com/WaCoDiS/datasource-observer)** if new required datasets are found. Following,
the Metadata Connector checks whether metadata for the found datasets have been already registered at the 
**[Data Access API](https://github.com/WaCoDiS/data-access-api)** or not and creates or updates corresponding metadata
information.
### Modules
The WaCoDiS Metadata Connector comprises three Maven modules:
* __WaCoDiS Metadata Connector Models__  
This module contains Java classes that reflect the basic data model. This includes the data types specified with OpenAPI
in the WaCoDiS apis-and workflows repository. All model classes were generated by the OpenAPI Generator, which is integrated
and can be used as Maven Plugin within this module.  
* __WaCoDiS Metadata Listener__  
This module is responsible for the message broker subscription as well as the interconnection to the Data Access API.
In addition, for each DataEnvelope type it contains a separate metadata update strategy.  
* __WaCoDiS Metadata Connector App__ 
Since WaCoDiS Metadata Connector is implemented as Spring Boot application, the App module provides the application runner
as well as default externalized configurations.
### Technologies
* __Java__  
WaCoDiS Metadata Connector is tested with Oracle JDK 8 and OpenJDK 8. Unless stated otherwise later Java versions can be used as well.
* __Maven__  
This project uses the build-management tool [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
* __Spring Boot__  
WaCoDiS Metadata Connector is a standalone application built with the [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) 
framework. Therefore, it is not necessary to deploy WaCoDiS Data Access manually with a web server.  
* __Spring Cloud__  
[Spring Cloud](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud) is used for exploiting some ready-to-use features in order to implement
an event-driven workflow. In particular, [Spring Cloud Stream](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-stream) is used
for subscribing to asynchronous messages within the WaCoDiS system.
* __RabbitMQ__  
For communication with other WaCoDiS components of the WaCoDiS system the message broker [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)
is utilized. RabbitMQ is not part of WaCoDiS Metadata Connector and therefore [must be deployed separately](#preconditions).
* __OpenAPI__  
[OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) is used for the specification of data models used within this project.

## Installation / Building Information
### Build from Source
In order to build the WaCoDiS Metadata Connector from source _Java Development Kit_ (JDK) must be available. Data Access 
is tested with Oracle JDK 8 and OpenJDK 8. Unless stated otherwise later JDK versions can be used.  

Since this is a Maven project, [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) must be available for building it. Then, you
can build the project by running `mvn clean install` from root directory

### Build using Docker
The project contains a Dockerfile for building a Docker image. Simply run `docker build -t wacodis/metadata-connector:latest .`
in order to build the image. You will find some detailed information about running the Metadata Connector as Docker container
within the [run section](#using-docker) .

### Configuration
Configuration is fetched from [WaCoDiS Config Server](https://github.com/WaCoDiS/config-server). If config server is not
available, configuration values located at *src/main/resources/application.yml* within the Metadata Connector App submodule
are applied instead.   
#### Parameters
WaCoDiS Metadata Connector is a Spring Boot application and provides an _application.yml_ within the metadata-connector-app
module for configuration purpose. A documentation for common application properties can be found at
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/appendix-application-properties.html

In addition, some configuration parameters relate to different Spring Cloud components, i.e. [Spring Cloud Stream](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/current/reference/html/)
and [Spring Cloud Config](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/docs/current/reference/html/).

To get started the most relevant configuration parameters are described below.

* `spring.rabbitmq.host`: Name of the node running a RabbitMQ instance
* `spring.rabbitmq.port`: RabbitMQ port to connect to
* `spring.rabbitmq.username`: Username for RabbitMQ connections
* `spring.rabbitmq.password`: Password for RabbitMQ connectio
* `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input-data-envelope.destination`: Topic used to listen for published DataEnvelope messages
* `dataaccess.uri`: URL that points to a WaCoDiS DataAccess API instance

## Deployment
### Dependencies
WaCoDiS Metadata Connector requires a running RabbitMQ instance for consuming messages as well as a running
WaCoDiS DataAccess API for creating or updating metadata resources. For starting a RabbitMQ instance as Docker container
a _docker-compose.yml_ is provided at _./docker/rabbitmq_. Detailed deployment instructions for the DataAccess API can 
be found at https://github.com/WaCoDiS/data-access-api. 

### Run with Maven
Just start the application by running `mvn spring-boot:run` from the root of the `metadata-connector-app` module. Make
sure you have installed all dependencies with `mvn clean install` from the project root.

### Run with Docker
For convenience, a _docker-compose.yml_ is provided for running the Metadata Connector as Docker container. Just, run 
`docker-compose up` from the project root. The latest Docker image will be fetched from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/wacodis/metadata-connector). The _docker-compose.yml_ also contains the  
most important configuration parameters as environment variables. Feel free to adapt the parameters for your needs.

## User Guide
WaCoDiS Metadata Connector is part of the great microservice-oriented WaCoDiS System with the scope to handle metadata
information about datasets that have been published by [WaCoDiS Datasource Observer](https://github.com/WaCoDiS/datasource-observer).
For this prupose it listens for asynchronous `DataEnvelope` messages and interconnects to [WaCoDiS DataAccess API](https://github.com/WaCoDiS/data-access-api). Hence, Metadata Connector does not provide an API endpoint that can be 
requested. However, for development or testing purposes you can publish `DataEnvelope` messages manually via AMQP. A
lightweigt AMQP publishing client can be found at https://github.com/WaCoDiS/Tools.
